	moving all over the place, outside of card when screen size change. 

Carousel:
	Multi image per slide. Currently responsive.
	Must make image size uniform. Indicators and prev/next arrows not always visible
	Image captions -- consider adding
	Once fully functioning - this can take the place of the Gallery.

	
Gallery -
	16 cards -- take way too much space. 
	Maybe card text - name of service, flip card for details
	consider a carousel
	change background to match #accordionTeam section

	<td><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-xs remove" data-toggle="confirmation" 
                        data-placement="right" 
                        data-popout="true"

                        data-btn-cancel-icon-class="material-icons" data-btn-cancel-icon-content="close"
                        data-title="Is it ok?" data-content="This might be dangerous">
                        <i class="fas fa-trash-alt fa-2x"></i>
                      </button></td>

	table: fix the thead and the tfoot, make tbody scrollable
