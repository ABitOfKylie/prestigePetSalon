Notes - in Progress

Scrollspy - not working - (as you scroll down the page, nav items highlighted accordingly)

Nav bar -
	Services dropdown: About, etc. BUT Massage href# not pointing to Team/PhysicalTherapist/Bruno Description in accordion.
	
	Contact Us dropdown: Join Us, Find Us, Book... change?
	Sign In (with welcome username - href direct to appt)

	Contact Us - dropdown  overflows right side.


Services section
#service .card 
	goal: equal height
	remove white border that becomes apparent md & lg
	col-md-12  col-lg-4

#spaButton
<a href="" id="spaButton" role="button" class="round pink">Tempted?<span class="round">Indulge and luxuriate. Book Now!</span></a>

Issue: Tempted text shows in background. 
			.pink:hover{content:hidden, content:none not working}
Responsiveness:
	768 3 col. middle column button moving outside of card when screen size change.
	640 1 col only - too much bottom padding  
	recheck this -- 

Section modalGallery:
background-image - same solution as Testimonials but not working here
Carousel inside Modal:
	Multi image per slide. Currently responsive.
	Indicators and prev/next arrows not always visible
	Individualism group of slides need fixing -- object fit or zoom...
Responsiveness
At 768 - still 3 columns but the See More Images Buttons are living their own lives - over stretches the modal footer. 640, 1024 and larger all work - just 768 problematic.
Button Focus -- See More Images Buttons: focus hover darker color - stays dark after click. Only disappears when you click on something else...kind of like a blur effect. Not sure how to override.

	Appointment: 
	styling!
	remove button currently 3 options popover on hover, tooltip on hover and modal on click - hover will not work on phones but! modal creates extra clicks for user. 
	Changed color of tooltip to match color of trash icon. 
	Thinking stick with tooltip (forget about phone size 4 now)

	<td><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-xs remove" data-toggle="confirmation" 
                        data-placement="right" 
                        data-popout="true"
                        data-btn-ok-label="Continue" data-btn-ok-class="btn-success"
                        data-btn-ok-icon-class="material-icons" data-btn-ok-icon-content="check"
                        data-btn-cancel-label="Stoooop!" data-btn-cancel-class="btn-danger"
                        data-btn-cancel-icon-class="material-icons" data-btn-cancel-icon-content="close"
                        data-title="Is it ok?" data-content="This might be dangerous">
                        <i class="fas fa-trash-alt fa-2x"></i>
                      </button></td>

	table: fix the thead and the tfoot, make tbody scrollable
	overflow:auto;
  overflow-x:hidden;
  height:100px; example

  same height & width for both cards 

	
	Ideas: Advanced Feature(at sign in - could get message, hey canine name, welcome back would you like your usual? checkbox - at which point it would direct directly to Service Selection with preselected items.)
	Customize this visit then reveal 3 cards?
	3 main cards
	Classic Radio buttons, 
		choose 1 Basic, Deluxe, or Deluxe Plus
		when hover for description
	
	Add Ons Check boxes choose multiple

	Spa Packages - radio buttons , hover for more info?

	Comments/Special needs - text field
	Radio button: Save this as my favorite service combo - 
	Phone number - text field
	radio button Yes you can text me
